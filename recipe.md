Put in the freezer to set for 20 mins while you make the caramel and melt the chocolate.
**Caramel Layer:**
In a food processor add all ingredients for the caramel layer and blend until super smooth and caramel-like, this may take up to 5 minutes depending on your food processor and you may need to add a little more water if it is a bit clumpy and not blending!
Take out your base layer once it has fully set (should take 20 mins) and spread out the caramel layer on top of the base layer so it is smooth and well spread out. Put bake in the freezer to set again while you melt your chocolate.
Chocolate
Melt your chocolate by using a water bath or bain marie. Once melted pour over the top of the caramel layer.
